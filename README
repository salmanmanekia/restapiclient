Instructions on running:

* mvn package
* java -cp target/LightSpeedPOSClient-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.zoined.restapiclient.LightSpeedPOSClient

Result: 

If there is some new data which can be retreived from API then the related CSV file can be found in the /target folder otherwise a message is displayed.

Things to remember:

During the first execution of the program the receipt which is created after the start of year 2015 is only considered.
During the second execution the receipt which has been created in the API since the last execution is shown.
If you have to reset this behaviour or change the initial date then you to clear the Preferences. For more details http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html#clear%28%29
